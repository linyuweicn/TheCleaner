      feedbackText: Hmm. This one is a bit dark. I suppose in can work if done the
        right way, but the NEA doesn't like content that focuses on the failures
        of our modern world.

      feedbackText: This is a great idea! So little is known about Atlantis, so it
        has a lot of potential to be a cool world to explore.

      feedbackText: 'It is no doubt that such world settings bring excitement and
        fantasies, but I''m also concerned if we go too far and get the NEA''s attention.  '

      feedbackText: Troubled times are always infused with all kinds of conflicts,
        and conflicts are so central to our game-making. Keep going with it, I really
        like the perspective you are taking.

      feedbackText: Hmmm, so it has been done a lot. But Maybe there could be futuristic
        vehicles other than the usual ones we've seen in a racing game? I'd like
        to see your imagination on this.

      feedbackText: Do we really want to encourage our impressionable children to
        engage in wonton violence? I feel like we can do better and I'm confident
        the NEA will say the same.

      feedbackText: Who needs action and violence when you have EDUCATION! The NEA
        loves anything that is kid-friendly, so this will be very easy to approve.

      feedbackText: I like the different perspectives of the action game you are
        trying to explore. I also believe 2D games have unique traits that attract
        players, keep adventuring!

        ban it outright but be aware that they are scrutinizing these games more
        than others. '
