      feedbackText: Hmm. This one is a bit dark. I suppose in can work if done the
        right way, but the NEA doesn't like content that focuses on the failures
        of our modern world.

        vehicles other than the usual ones we've seen in a racing game? I'd like
        to see your imagination on this.
